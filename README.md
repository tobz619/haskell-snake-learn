# Snake

I'm learning to make Snake in Haskell with local and multiplayer scoreboards: maybe extend with a second player and more levels.

## Purpose

- I need to learn database
- I want to learn some Funtional Reactive Programming
- I want to practice my Haskell + Nix workflow

## Current problems
- I want the 'PAUSED' text to appear overlayed on the game and I can't figure out how to do this with Brick - yet.
- I have no idea how to implement DB for high scores.
